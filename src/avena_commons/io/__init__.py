üöÄ Core Components Overview
===========================

üåê Bus Protocols (bus module)
-----------------------------
Industrial communication protocol implementations managed by IO_server:

‚Ä¢ **EtherCAT**: Real-time EtherCAT protocol for automation

‚Ä¢ **ModbusRTU**: Serial communication over RS485/RS232

‚Ä¢ **ModbusTCP**: TCP/IP-based Modbus for Ethernet networks

Protocols are configured in JSON and automatically initialized by IO_server:
- Connection management and device discovery
- Real-time data exchange with connected devices
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization and cycle timing

üîß Device Drivers (device module)
---------------------------------
Physical device drivers loaded through configuration and managed by IO_server:

**I/O Devices (8 types):**
- Digital/analog input/output modules
- Mixed I/O expansion units
- Safety I/O systems
- High-speed counter modules

**Motor Drivers (2 types):**
- Servo motor controllers with position feedback
- Stepper motor drivers with microstepping

**Sensors (8 types):**

All devices are:
- Configured via JSON with bus protocol assignments
- Automatically connected and validated by IO_server

- Monitored for connection status and errors

‚ö° IO_server - Event Processing Engine
-------------------------------------
Central event-driven I/O management system that:
- Loads complete system configuration from JSON files
- Initializes and manages all buses, devices, and virtual devices

- Supports configuration merging (general + local overrides)

üñ•Ô∏è VirtualDevice - Device Interface Template
---------------------------------------------
Abstract base class template for creating virtual device interfaces to real hardware:
- Configured in JSON with method mappings to physical devices
- Standardized interface for complex device operations
- Hardware abstraction layer managed by IO_server
- Event-driven control through IO_server routing
- Device state monitoring and lifecycle management

üí° Practical Usage Examples
===========================

IO_server Configuration-Based Setup:
```python
from avena_commons.io import IO_server

# Initialize IO_server with configuration files
# All buses, devices, and virtual devices are loaded from JSON config
server = IO_server(
    name="industrial_io_server",
    port=8080,
    configuration_file="local_config.json",
    general_config_file="default_config.json",
    debug=True
)

# Server automatically loads and manages:
# - Bus protocols (EtherCAT, ModbusRTU, ModbusTCP)
# - Physical devices (I/O modules, motor drivers, sensors)
# - Virtual devices (device interfaces with methods)
await server.start()
```

    "bus": {
        "ethercat_master": {

Event-Driven Device Control:
```python
# Send events to virtual devices through IO_server
from avena_commons.event_listener import Event

# Create event for virtual device
event = Event(
    source="munchies_algo",
    destination="localhost:8080",
    event_type="feeder_move_to_position",
    data={
        "device_id": "1",
        "position": 1500,
        "velocity": 2000
    }
)

# IO_server routes event to feeder1 virtual device
# which calls servo_drive_1.move_absolute(position=1500, velocity=2000)
await event_client.send_event(event)
```

üîÑ Integration Patterns
=======================

**Configuration-Driven Architecture:**
IO_server manages the entire system through JSON configuration:
- Declarative device setup without manual initialization
- Automatic bus protocol assignment and device discovery
- Configuration merging for deployment flexibility
- Centralized error handling and device validation

**Event-Driven Device Control:**
All device interactions happen through IO_server event routing:
- Events sent to virtual device names (e.g., "feeder1")
- IO_server routes to appropriate physical device methods
- Asynchronous processing with automatic error recovery
- Real-time device state monitoring and lifecycle management

**Hierarchical Device Management:**
Three-layer architecture managed by IO_server:
- **Bus Layer**: Protocol implementations (EtherCAT, Modbus)
- **Device Layer**: Physical device drivers with bus assignments
- **Virtual Device Layer**: High-level interfaces with method mappings

**Configuration File Patterns:**
Flexible configuration structure supports:
- General configuration files for default settings
- Local configuration files for deployment-specific overrides
- Method mappings connecting virtual devices to physical operations
- Bus protocol assignments for automatic device connections

‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features
===================

‚Ä¢ **Configuration Management**: JSON-based device setup with general and local file merging

‚Ä¢ **Automatic Discovery**: IO_server discovers and validates all configured devices on startup

‚Ä¢ **Event Routing**: Intelligent routing of events to virtual devices based on event_type patterns

‚Ä¢ **Device Lifecycle**: Automatic initialization, connection validation, and error recovery

‚Ä¢ **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous device state checking through virtual device tick() methods

‚Ä¢ **Error Isolation**: Device-level error handling prevents single failures from affecting the system

‚Ä¢ **Method Mapping**: Flexible virtual device method definitions connecting to physical device operations

‚Ä¢ **Hot Configuration**: Support for configuration changes without system restart (future enhancement)

This module is essential for industrial automation systems requiring robust I/O management
through configuration-driven setup and event-based device control. All device interactions
are managed centrally by IO_server, eliminating the need for direct bus or device manipulation.
